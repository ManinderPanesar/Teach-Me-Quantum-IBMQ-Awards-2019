# Teach Me Quantum
This lecture series is prepared towards submission for IBMQ Awards - Teach Me Quantum 2019. 
This is a designated 11-week course covering concepts in quantum physics, quantum chemistry, mathematics, computer science NP-hard problems, 
cryptography, ensemble based learning and much more. This is the first holistic course ever designed in Quantum Computing. 
This course is prepared for people from backgrounds in physics, mathematics, chemistry and computer science. 
Some exercise questions are tailored specifically towards these domains. For the exam perspective, this is a 10-week course. 
People with backgrounds in physics and chemistry can skip the week on cryptography and people from mathematics and computer science backgrounds 
can skip the week on quantum hardware.    

My contributions: I specifically made course material with coding exercises and solutions in quantum variational methods like VQE, QAOA; Quantum machine learning protocols and quantum hardware.

Update: Our team won second prize in the IBMQ 2019 Teach Me Quantum Awards with a cash prize of $4000
